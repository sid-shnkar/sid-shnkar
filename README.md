I am a passionate self-taught software developer and currently pursuing my B.Tech in CSE from IIT Dharwad. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build. I am a self-motivated person and looking further to enhance my skills and knowledge in the best ways I can do.
